# Next.js 15 App Router Middleware Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using middleware with dynamic routes.  The middleware does not behave as expected, resulting in unexpected behavior.  This issue may manifest in various ways, such as incorrect route matching, missing data, or unexpected redirects.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the unexpected behavior.

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should correctly handle requests for dynamic routes and apply appropriate logic (e.g., redirects, data fetching) according to the route parameters.

## Actual Behavior

The middleware fails to function correctly or unexpectedly modifies the request or response leading to incorrect behavior in the app.

## Solution

The solution involves refining the middleware function and potentially adjusting the dynamic route configuration to ensure proper interaction between middleware and the App Router's routing mechanism.  The solution file provides a corrected implementation.
